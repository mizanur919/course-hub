The Most Modern Mobile Touch Slider. Easily we can make sliders of different types.

## React Router [Click Here](https://reactrouter.com/) to install
Here I have used version 6 for routing. Using this package we can easily route our pages easily.

## Fontawesome [Click Here](https://fontawesome.com/) use
To use a hassle-free icon we can use it.
We can also use [React Icon](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) Package instead of using Fontawesome.
